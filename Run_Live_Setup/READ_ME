Run_live command set-up:

In order to set-up the command "run_live" that automatically will launch a psiturk server, get a debug link, change the link to a live version of the experiment (which is useful for working with status codes for participants) and copy the link to your clipboard, do the following:

1. cd into this folder in command line
2. change your permissions using "chmod +x create_run_live.sh"
3. run the file using "./create_run_live.sh"
4. Delete this read_me, the shell script and the folder this came in (the command will not work again -- unless redownloaded -- as it has already moved a file required for it to work).
